### What is ethically ambiguous data modeling?

To define ethically ambiguous data modeling we need to begin by defining exactly what we are doing in practice; Essentially we make statical models to make assumptions about the world around us, and within the world we find it to be a very convoluted place (mixed opinions, morals, and overall different views on what is ethical or not). We find that as data scientist these convoluted views get embedded in the very model that essentially is supposed to make an unbiased decision. With this definition in mind we can define ethically ambiguous data modeling as first coming to the realization that this is a big issue, and then implementing solutions that not only avoid new biases but also mitigate the old one; By not only avoiding new biases but also mitigating old ones we can define our approach as being ethically ambiguous.

### Articulating base practices for assuaging ethical challenges

When articulating base practices with respect to mitigating ethical challenges establishing breadth and disparity of a population would be a great first approach; This would give us a great opportunity to model our ethical challenges as population proportions. Personally, I believe population portions to be extremely effective given we have enough understanding of the population in question and our sample, however by understanding I'm trying to communicate specificity due to the fact a population would be truly under represented if we fail to recognize them. This is actually a really interesting challenge because race does not imply ethnicity and ethnicity its self does not imply these convoluted views we spoke about previously, however through inference I believe if we can connect the unique breadth and disparity to a samples features our model should be able to generalize for that specific ethnic group rather than presenting a biased prediction. To define it as unbiased would be trivial since our statical approach for establishing a consensus for breadth and disparity is based on a generalization. I do strongly believe if you have real-world experience with the population in question ethically ambiguity can be achieved, yet this real-world experience you bring will in turn get embedded into the model.

### Real World Examples

In summary the world is a very convoluted place and these very opinons can get embeded into our model and cause it to ultimately fail in the long-term. To mitgate this we chose to establish the breadth and disparity through population proportions, yet we noticed that the generalzation of ethnic groups needs to be considered, however modeling breadth and disparity is still a realistic option when mitigating ethnic biases. With the winter storm coming lets ask the tough question of how does this bump in the road affects different communites. We can further refine this to ask does our current infrastructure for dealing with winter storms put marginalized groups at a further disadvantage. This is a great question because we just encompassed the entire population of charlotte which in turn is a melting pot of different groups. To answer this question, the analysis should focus on how severe weather restricts access to critical infrastructure for marginalized populations. Limited access to transportation can disrupt public transit, food distribution, and the ability to reach warming shelters. These constraints often affect marginalized groups more acutely due to higher dependency on shared infrastructure. One possible approach is to categorize individuals based on situational factors such as homelessness, fixed income status, marginalization without fixed income constraints, and non-marginalized status, recognizing that overlap between categories may exist. Many of these variables can be modeled as binary features, with income treated as a continuous variable. Ultimately, mitigating ethnic bias requires accounting for population breadth and diversity while modeling individuals based on both their current socioeconomic circumstances and the ethnic identities they report. Examining the interaction between these variables can provide meaningful insight into how well existing infrastructure serves marginalized groups during periods of environmental stress.
